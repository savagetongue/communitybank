/**
 * ChronoBank-specific entities will be defined here in future phases.
 * The boilerplate entities have been removed to resolve type errors.
 */
// Example of what a future entity might look like:
/*
import { IndexedEntity } from "./core-utils";
import type { Member } from "@shared/types";
export class MemberEntity extends IndexedEntity<Member> {
  static readonly entityName = "member";
  static readonly indexName = "members";
  static readonly initialState: Member = {
    id: "",
    name: "",
    email: "",
    rating: 0,
    isProvider: false,
    createdAt: "",
  };
}
